# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m Faisal, a sophomore Computer Science student at Umm Al-Qura University (UQU), passionate about problem-solving, software development, and building efficient and scalable solutions.  
Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on mastering C++ and Java for algorithms and data structures, as well as expanding my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

Iâ€™m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to open-source projects.  
You can find me here on GitHub sharing my projects, experiments, and learning journey.
